\noindent This work's purpose is based on the proposal for an experimental project of an integral-solution platform for the internationalisation management at Universidad de Granada. To accomplish it, we start with the analysis of an existent tool with big shortages, so that we can examine in depth its needs and thus achieve one of the main goals of this project: taking the leap to the Internet. Everything is carried through by the application of agile methodologies user-focused methodologies, which have as a result a valuable software production, which aims the fulfillment of the user needs above all, who contribute with their feedback throughout all the process.
